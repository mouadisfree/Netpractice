*My network configuration and subnetting project*
---
## What is this?
**Netpractice** is a collection of network configuration exercises that I solved myself. It's a school project that helps me learn how networking works, IP addresses, subnetting, and routing. I'll use this networking knowledge in other projects later.

---

## What I Learned

### IP Addressing
- **IPv4**: Understanding 32-bit addresses and notation
- **Subnetting**: Dividing networks into smaller subnets
- **CIDR**: Classless Inter-Domain Routing notation

### Network Components
- **Routers**: Connect different networks together
- **Switches**: Connect devices within same network
- **Interfaces**: Network connection points

### Configuration Skills
- `Subnet Masks`: Calculate network and host portions
- `Default Routes`: Set up routing tables
- `Network Planning`: Design efficient network topologies

## How to use it

### What you need
To practice networking, you need:
- A web browser to access the Netpractice interface
- Basic understanding of binary and decimal conversion

### How to set it up
1. Download the exercises:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mkatfi/Netpractice.git
   cd Netpractice


2. Open the exercises:
   ```bash
   # Open index.html in your browser
   # Complete each level step by step
   ```

   This opens the interactive network configuration exercises.

## Thanks
Thanks to 1337 School and all my peers who helped me learn!
